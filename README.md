# Preamble
(What will eventually be) A full, detailed breakdown on how to mod *cheap* baolian arcade buttons into genuine alternatives to sanwas with aggressively reduced Z height allowing for much thinner builds and gaining the benefits of keyboard switches!

Initial concept of hand filed MX mod by me, iterated upon by Ebin to suggest internally mounted choc switches, and then taken by me to Hadoe for assistance in designing PCB. All PCB work performed by him, he is a saint and I straight up would never have seen this mod through without his expertise and patience. GO BUY HIS RECTANGLES, https://htangl.com

**DISCLAIMER**
Right now, this is a disaster dumping ground just to get these files and guides out to the public. This is very painfully a work in progress and I desperately need more than 24 hours in the day to get all the things done I'm working on right now, so please accept the files herein as being extremely raw and without context. Even my little picture showing the steps is out of focus lmao, I have so much to do

# Pictures For Context

A button on its own:

# Purchase Link(s)
Here's the listing I used to order a set of 50 white slotted buttons: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32817156907.html

IMPORTANT NOTE: I cannot guarantee that any other colours or even another order of whites will be slotted or slotless. The product pictures in the listing are inconsistent. Slotless are less than useless, so be warned.

# Closing
If you have Qs (tbh wih how scuffy this is you should have at least a few), ping me in Crane's discord, found at https://craneslab.xyz/discord
